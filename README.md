# ForzaDatasport-Ruby
Experimental first attempt at creating some Ruby tools for Forza Motorsport (2023) Data out.

# Concept
This is still a very early stage of this project.

The end goal is to create some Ruby tools with which to make use of the Data Out feature of Forza Motorsport 2023
for the XBOX.

Additionally I hope to create an easy to use / configurable browser-based dashboard for displaying real-time
telemetry and other info.

Perhaps ultimately, I'll see about making a ForzaMotorsportData gem - or some other broadly useful items.

# Current Status

Currently, the project will allow you to:
1) Collect USP data stream from XBOX
2) parse the data into usable / labled JSON data
3) view a simple display of the data in a web-browser
